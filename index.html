<h3 id="backstory">A few words about my backstory:</h3>
<div class="medium-8 medium-offset-2">
<p>Five years in Paris were enough to realise I was in the wrong place in the wrong industry, so I packed my bags, gave up my career in the sound industry and flew to the Yukon Territory for a one year working visa.</p>
<p>I met my awesome wife when I came back, fast forward a few years and we are now raising a wonderful daughter.</p>
<p>While trying to figure out a new career path I started to sell my sound designer skills in the form of online products on third party sites. This went very well and got me started in online marketing, as I began to teach myself seo, blogging and coding to sell more of my sounds. Meanwhile, I went back to school and graduated a bachelor degree in business management.</p>
<p>Soon after graduating I started working for Qualifirst, where I was given the chance to grow my skills and gradually become their ecommerce manager. I currently dedicate my time between Qualifirst and my blog and I'm passionate about both.</p>
<p>I purposefully live in a remote countryside in the south west of France and work from my home office. This is the best way to provide a healthy, happy, and secure lifestyle for my family. Crowded areas like Paris or other big european cities are  poisonous and dangerous. I intend to keep working remotely as long as possible as it suits perfectly and allows me to be very productive.</p>
